# JUCE_Reverb

This is a reverb plugin made in juce, with the goal of supplying a parameter based reverb, as well as a convolution reverb. This plugin was created for a course audio programming and was practice for using juce and its possibilities. The Theme of my reverb is cheese, as it was originally the idea to create multiple food themed plugins that create a burger. However this idea of the class was not finished, even so, I still implemented the cheese theme myself.
